xfbuild
=======

This is a minimal port of the xfbuild utility (originally made by h3r3tic) to D2.
The original repository and more documentation can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/h3r3tic/xfbuild/wiki/Home

Building
-------

This port uses the TangoD2 library, which you can obtain here: https://github.com/SiegeLord/Tango-D2

Then you can run the usual build commands:

* ./build.sh - if you have dmd
* ./ldcBuild.sh - if you have ldc2
* build.bat - if you're on Windows and have dmd
